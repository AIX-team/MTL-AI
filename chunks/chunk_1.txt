[00:00:06] This island nation is really not that big area wise but there is so much to experience. [00:00:13] I had to come to terms with the fact that I wouldn't see everything in 3 weeks. [00:00:17] From Tokyo to Hiroshima to historical post towns, [00:00:21] I still saw so much on my trip and can't wait to come back for more. [00:00:35] I started my trip in Japan in Tokyo, the capital of Japan and [00:00:39] the largest city in the world by population. From Narita Airport I took the Narita Express [00:00:45] train to Tokyo station which took about an hour. Because I had a large suitcase with me I decided [00:00:52] to wait until after rush hour to get on the Metro. I inadvertently ended up witnessing a ceremony [00:00:58] of sorts for what seems to be a newly appointed official. [00:01:07] For my first stay in Tokyo, I chose to be in the Akasaka area, which is less [00:01:12] touristy but still very convenient. I would definitely stay here again. [00:01:26] A 7-Eleven was integrated right into my hotel so you can bet that that was my very first stop. [00:01:52] Ramen, if you don't already know, is a Japanese noodle dish that has become a cultural icon in the [00:01:57] country and famous around the world. It's served in a delicious broth, [00:02:01] often with pork slices and dried seaweed. [00:02:08] I also had to pop into Don Quijote to take a look as I was planning to do some shopping later before I left Japan. [00:02:15] It's a discount store chain selling basically everything [00:02:18] from groceries to makeup to electronics. I spent way too long just browsing in there. [00:02:33] I started off the next morning by heading to Shibuya. [00:02:37] Standing at the famous Shibuya scramble Crossing it really hit me that I was finally here in Tokyo. [00:02:44] This crossing is the world's busiest pedestrian crossing. [00:02:47] Every 2 minutes all traffic is stopped so that pedestrians can cross in all directions. [00:02:59] For lunch I went to Gyukatsu Motomura. Something I had to learn early on was [00:03:05] that for popular restaurants here you have to be strategic when you go, if you don't [00:03:09] want to spend your whole day waiting. Luckily the wait wasn't too bad

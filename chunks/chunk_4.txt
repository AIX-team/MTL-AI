photos so I was pleasantly surprised by just how immersive it was. [00:12:48] Near TeamLab Planets is Odaiba, a shopping and entertainment district on an artificial island. [00:12:54] The train that goes there is overground, providing a really nice view of the city. [00:13:17] Odaiba itself feels quite modern and surprisingly quiet compared to everywhere else I'd been in [00:13:22] Tokyo. It did also feel just slightly kitschy, what with the Statue of Liberty replica, [00:13:28] but it wasn't to the detriment of the pleasant waterfront area. [00:13:45] At this point I left Tokyo to explore some other places, which will be in the next few videos. [00:13:50] So fast forward in another 2 weeks, I came back to Tokyo and spent my last few days in the Shibuya [00:13:55] area at a hotel that provided free ramen, and I managed to tick off a few more things. [00:14:01] I ended up booking a traditional tea ceremony with a kimono rental because [00:14:05] by the time I realized I wanted to do it in Kyoto, they were all booked up. [00:14:10] No filming was allowed during the tea ceremony but I was allowed to take the kimono out afterwards. [00:14:15] I was surprised by just how warm wearing a kimono is. [00:14:21] Shibuya Sky is an open air observation deck that gives [00:14:24] you a really good panoramic view of the city. Sunset is the best time as you get to see the [00:14:30] city transition from day to night, but you will have to book ahead. [00:15:05] And I was even here for Halloween. [00:15:19] Although the authorities are really cracking down on Halloween in Shibuya now, [00:15:23] which is understandable, there were still lots of people out and about in costumes [00:15:27] so that was still really really fun to see. [00:15:31] Stay tuned to find out where I went during my 2 weeks outside of Tokyo.

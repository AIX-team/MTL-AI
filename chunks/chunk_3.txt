sushi restaurant near my hotel because the hotel gave a 10% discount for it. [00:08:32] I feel like the food standards in Japan are so high that you probably can't go to wrong anywhere. [00:08:52] The sun came back out Monday morning and I got up a bit earlier to go to Tsukiji Outer Market. [00:08:58] I got there just before 8 and it was already pretty busy. [00:09:02] The wholesale market, which was famous for tuna auctions, was closed in 2018, [00:09:06] so only the outer market remains here, where you can buy fresh seafood and produce. [00:09:12] It's also a good place to get a fresh seafood rice bowl, known as kaisendon, for breakfast. [00:09:21] From here it's walking distance to the Ginza district, an upscale shopping area. [00:09:30] Ginza 6 is a luxury shopping complex located here. [00:09:36] While I wasn't here to shop they did have a cool bookstore on their top floor. [00:09:46] Most importantly, I was told that the rooftop garden is quite nice. [00:10:26] Ginza 6 also features a number of restaurants so I had my lunch here at Ginza Sanada 6. [00:10:32] This restaurant specializes in cold soba, buckwheat noodles served with dipping sauce. [00:10:37] It's a great dish to have on hot summer days. [00:10:46] Japan is known to have a lot of animal cafes so I ended up visiting an owl cafe. [00:10:52] The reservation is for an hour but for the first 15 minutes, the owls get a break, so you can just sit and enjoy the included drink. [00:11:10] They teach you how to pet the different owls and you get to feed them some mice. [00:11:15] While the owls were really adorable, I do want to point out that the space did seem [00:11:19] a bit cramped especially considering how many people are also in there during one time slot. [00:11:32] Japan has a lot of these fast food chains where you can get set meals [00:11:35] for really affordable prices. Matsuya is one of them. [00:11:38] It specializes in Gyudon or beef bowls, but I came here for some breakfast. [00:11:45] This doesn't look all that pretty, but hey, [00:11:47] it was only around 5 to 6 Canadian dollars, so I'm not complaining. [00:11:53] On this day I visited TeamLab Planets, an immersive collection of art installations. [00:11:57] I didn't know too much about it coming into this other than having [00:12:00] seen a few

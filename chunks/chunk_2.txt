when I [00:03:13] got here but it means I wouldn't really learn my lesson until later that day. [00:03:17] This place specializes in beef cutlet that you cook yourself over a hot stone, [00:03:21] and I have to say the beef really was incredibly tender and delicious. [00:03:30] After strolling through Takesita Street in Harajuku, I went to visit the Meiji shrine. [00:03:48] Set in a peaceful forested area within the busy city, [00:03:52] it's a Shinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. [00:04:08] Right next to Meiji Shrine is Yoyogi Park, one of the largest parks in Tokyo. [00:04:22] Here I admired how large the crows of Tokyo were compared to those in Vancouver. [00:04:27] I thought they were ravens at first. [00:04:43] For dinner I headed to Udon Shin. At first glance the line didn't [00:04:47] look too bad but it turns out you have to get a ticket first, [00:04:50] and it said it was a 2-hour wait but you could leave and come back when called. [00:04:54] So I decided to go for a walk around the Shinjuku area. [00:05:16] What I didn't realize when I finally got called to return to the restaurant was that [00:05:19] you still have to line up outside which ended up being another hour. [00:05:41] The next day I headed to the district of Asakusa. [00:05:46] Known for retaining more of Tokyo's historic atmosphere, it is home to Sensoji, [00:05:51] a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century. On the way to the temple you walk through a [00:05:56] shopping street called Nakamise, where you can find vendors and local snacks. [00:06:19] In the temple you can draw your fortune called omikuji. [00:07:16] After the temple I picked up some Karaage, or Japanese fried chicken, [00:07:20] from a street stall nearby called Asakusa Chicken. [00:07:35] From there I walk to Ueno Park, another large public park in Tokyo. [00:07:40] Here you can find the Tokyo National Museum which houses a large collection of Japanese art. [00:07:55] I decided to spend the next day working in the hotel since it [00:07:58] was raining butI did go out for my meals. At lunch I went to Savoy Tomato and Cheese, [00:08:07] a neapolitan pizza place recommended by a friend. This time I made sure to get there before opening [00:08:13] and so I got seated right away when they opened. [00:08:27] And at dinner I just went to a
